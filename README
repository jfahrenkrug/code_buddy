# Code Buddy

Cody Buddy is a simple Meteor.js app that lets you share code snippets across multiple browsers, even across the internet.

I've built it for teaching iOS classes: All participants open their browsers, connect to the site and I can easily push code snippets to them.

## Setup

* Install Meteor.js from http://meteor.com/
* Start the app:

    cd code_buddy
    meteor

* Open http://localhost:3000

## Beware

It's still very very ugly and after trying different things and asking on IRC, I haven't gotten auto-syntax highlighting after an update to work yet.
